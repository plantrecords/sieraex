SIERA ex (Single Island Endemic Representativeness Analysis for Ex Situ Collections) is an interactive Shiny web application built in R for assessing the geographic representativeness of rare, single island endemic ex situ plant collections against wild collections on Kauaâ€˜i. 2km buffer ranges are selected by default, in line with IUCN AOO standards, however 1km buffers may be preferable for higher resolution (It may be applicable to other islands and possibly continental areas as well; for this reason, buffer size options >2 km are available.) The program accommodates analyses at the highest taxonomic rank (e.g. genus, when hybridization occurs) while retaining specific and infraspecific metadata (see [documentation](https://github.com/plantrecords/sieraex/blob/main/comprehensive_instructions.md#siera-ex-documentation)). The app uses spatial data files along with user uploaded CSV datasets to perform gap analysis and generate a report on representativeness across geographic units. Program components and instructions including vector layers and sample datasets be downloaded and installed from this repository https://github.com/plantrecords/sieraex. Optional representativeness scoring and priority values can be manually calculated in concert with the software by following the steps laid out in ([Kevin's thesis](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.27268.64641)) as described in (see [documentation](https://github.com/plantrecords/sieraex/blob/main/comprehensive_instructions.md#siera-ex-documentation)).
