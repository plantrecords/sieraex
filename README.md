# SIERA-ex (Single Island Endemic Representativeness Analysis for ex situ Collections) 
SIERA-ex is an interactive Shiny web application built in R for assessing the geographic representativeness of rare, single island endemic ex situ plant collections against wild collections on Kauaâ€˜i. 2km buffer ranges are selected by default, in line with IUCN AOO standards, however 1km buffers may be preferable for higher resolution (It may be applicable to other islands and possibly continental areas as well; for this reason, buffer size options >2 km are available.) The program accommodates analyses at the highest taxonomic rank (e.g. genus, when hybridization occurs) while retaining specific and infraspecific metadata (see [documentation](https://github.com/plantrecords/sieraex/blob/main/comprehensive_instructions.md#siera-ex-documentation)). The app uses spatial data files along with user uploaded CSV datasets to perform gap analysis and generate a report on representativeness across geographic units. Program components and instructions including vector layers and sample datasets be downloaded and installed from [this repository](https://github.com/plantrecords/sieraex). Optional representativeness scoring and priority values can be manually calculated in concert with the software by following the steps laid out in [Kevin's thesis](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.27268.64641) as described in [documentation](https://github.com/plantrecords/sieraex/blob/main/comprehensive_instructions.md#siera-ex-documentation). 

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Install R & RStudio
- **R**: [Download from CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org)  
- **RStudio** (recommended): [Download here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop)

### 2. Clone or Download this Repository
### 3. Plac thee basemaps folder and subfolders in the same directory as sieraex.R
### 4. Install Required R Packages

In RStudio:

install.packages(c(
  "shiny", "leaflet", "DT", "dplyr", "sf",
  "plotly", "shinyBS", "raster", "leafem", "shinycssloaders"
))

Install additional packages as necessary.

### 5. Run the App

    Open sieraex.R in RStudio

    Click Run App

    Use the UI to:

        Upload sample wild and ex situ CSV datasets. To upload custom datasets, see [documentation](https://github.com/plantrecords/sieraex/blob/main/comprehensive_instructions.md#siera-ex-documentation).

        Curate points interactively

        Run gap analysis

        Generate representativeness report

## Deployment Considerations

SIERA ex is open source and designed to run in an RStudio/Leaflet environment on any platform (Mac, PC, etc.). You can run the app locally by executing the code in RStudio, or deploy it to a server (e.g., using shinyapps.io or a Shiny Server) if you wish to share it publicly.
